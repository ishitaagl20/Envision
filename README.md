# Envision: AI-Powered Assistance for the Visually Impaired

Envision is an innovative project aimed at assisting the visually impaired using advanced AI technologies. It leverages computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and wearable device integration to provide a seamless experience in everyday life.

## Features

- **Text Reading**: Convert text from any surface (books, documents, signs) into speech.
- **Face Recognition**: Identify familiar faces and notify the user.
- **Scene Description**: Describe the surroundings to help navigate unfamiliar environments.
- **Navigation Assistance**: Use AI to guide the user through unknown or crowded spaces with voice prompts.
- **Conversational Chatbot**: Interact with a conversational AI for instant help with queries or tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Computer Vision**: For face recognition and scene description.
- **Speech Recognition and Synthesis**: To read text aloud and communicate with the user.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For understanding and responding to user queries.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained for various tasks, including text-to-speech conversion and face recognition.
- **Wearable Devices**: Integrated with sensors to enhance the navigation features.
